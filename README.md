### Parkguidance 
  
The [parguidance system](https://github.com/Neoministein/parkguidance) system is designed to receive data from different parking garages in order to visibly displays the current capacity and Infos of the hooked-up parking garages and gives a rough estimate of its free capacity throughout the day. 

It also provides features as:
- Finding a parking garage near you 
- Finding a parking garage near an address 
- Showing a heatmap of the garage capacty througout the day

### DIY V-Tuber Software 

Using my Motion Capture Recording Software I integrated a 3d model with which you now have virtual avatar mimicing the motion. This can be used for recoring or live broadcasts with a virutal avatar.
